# Telegram Grabbag
A folderized collection of scripts and bots for Telegram.

A few of these were repositories of their own. I thought it would make most sense to combine them all in one spot. Each folder can be seen as its own standalone project.

'message_reposting' - Scripts that capture message ids for every post in a particular channel that has a video. Those message ids are output to a text file. The text file is then used as a simple log from which another script reposts three (or any number) of messages to the top of your channel, while deleting their earlier reference.
